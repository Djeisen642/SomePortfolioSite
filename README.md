# SomePortfolioSite

I've forgetten all the installation details...

However.

They involve following the Cold Fusion instructions to install and start Cold Fusion, installing the MySQL connector, setting up my SMTP server within the administration (that I had set up for another project), placing this project in the wwwroot folder, running import_mysql.sql,  and navigating to http://localhost:8500/SomePortfolioSite/index.cfm.

The cool changes are in resume.cfm.

# SomePortfolioSite

I've forgetten all the installation details...
However.
They involve following the ColdFusion instructions, installing the MySQL connector, setting up my SMTP server within the administration (that I had set up for another project), placing this project in the wwwroot folder, running import_mysql.sql, and navigating to http://localhost:8500/SomePortfolioSite/index.cfm.
